I. Updated Levels of Difficulty of Single/Pair Skating Elements (season 2019/20) LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY, SINGLE SKATING, season 2019/20
Number of features for Levels: 1 for Level 1, 2 for Level 2, 3 for Level 3, 4 for Level 4

Step Sequences
1) Minimum variety (Level 1), simple variety (Level 2), variety (Level 3), complexity (Level 4) of difficult turns and steps throughout (compulsory)
2) Rotations in either direction (left and right) with full body rotation covering at least 1/3 of the pattern in total for each rotational direction
3) Use of body movements for at least 1/3 of the pattern
4) Two different combinations of 3 difficult turns on different feet executed with continuous flow within the sequence. Only the first combination attempted on each foot can be counted.

All Spins
1) Difficult variations (count as many times as performed with limitations specified below)
2) Change of foot executed by jump
3) Jump within a spin without changing feet
4) Difficult change of position on the same foot
5) Difficult entrance into a spin
6) Clear change of edge in sit (only from backward inside to forward outside), camel, Layback and Biellmann position
7) All 3 basic positions on the second foot
8) Both directions immediately following each other in sit or camel spin
9) Clear increase of speed in camel, sit, layback or Biellmann position
10) At least 8 rev. without changes in position/variation, foot or edge (camel, layback, difficult variation of any basic position or for combinations only non-basic position)
11) Difficult variation of flying entry in flying spins/spins with a flying entrance (see Clarifications)

Additional features for the Layback spin:
12) One clear change of position backwards-sideways or reverse, at least 2 rev. in each position (counts also if the Layback position is a part of any other spin)
13) Biellmann position after Layback spin (SP – after 8 revolutions in layback spin)

Features 2-9, 11-13 count only once per program (first time they are attempted). Feature 10 counts only once per program (in the first spin it is successfully performed; if in this spin 8 revs are executed on both feet, any one of these executions can be taken in favour of the skater).
Any category of difficult spin variation in a basic position counts only once per program (first time it is attempted). A difficult variation in a non-basic position counts once per program in spin combination only (first time it is attempted).
In any spin with change of foot the maximum number of features attained on one foot is two (2).

ELEMENTS REQUIREMENTS (see also Clarifications on the next page)
1. Full rotation: signs < and << indicate an error. The base values of the jumps with a sign < are listed in the SOV table. The jump with a sign << is evaluated with SOV for the same jump one revolution less.
2. Correct take-off edge in F/Lz: signs “e” and “!” indicate an error. The base values of the jumps with the sign “e” are listed in the SOV table. The sign “!” allows to keep full original base value of the jump.
If both signs < and “e” are applied for the same jump, the base values are listed in the SOV table.

Spins
1. For flying spins (with no change of foot and only one position) of both Short Program and Free Skating the following is required: a clear visible jump. The sign “V” indicates that this requirement is not fulfilled. The base values of spins with the sign “V“ are listed in the SOV table.
2. The base values of spin combinations with only 2 basic positions (at least 2 revolutions in each of these positions) are also listed in the SOV table.
3. All spins with change of foot must have 3 revolutions on each foot. In Short Program, if this requirement is not fulfilled, the spin will get “No Value”. In Free Skating the sign “V” indicates that this requirement is not fulfilled. The base values of spins with the sign “V“ are listed in the SOV table.
4. Spin in one position with change of foot must have 2 revolutions in basic position on each foot. In Short Program, if this requirement is not fulfilled, the spin will get “No Value”. In Free Skating the sign “V” indicates that this requirement is not fulfilled. The base values of spins with the sign “V“ are listed in the SOV table.

Jumps
CLARIFICATIONS: LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY SINGLE SKATING, season 2019/20

STEP SEQUENCES
Types of difficult turns and steps: twizzles, brackets, loops, counters, rockers, choctaws.
Minimum variety includes at least 5 difficult turns and steps, none of the types can be counted more than twice.
Simple variety includes at least 7 difficult turns and steps, none of the types can be counted more than twice.
Variety includes at least 9 difficult turns and steps, none of the types can be counted more than twice.
Complexity includes at least 11 difficult turns and steps, none of the types can be counted more than twice, 5 types must be executed in both directions.
Use of body movement means the visible use for a combined total of at least 1/3 of the pattern of any movements of arms, head, torso, hips and legs that have an effect on the balance of the main body core.

SPINS
A difficult spin variation of position is a movement of the body part, leg, arm, hand or head which requires physical strength or flexibility and that has an effect on the balance of the main body core. Only these variations can increase the Level. There are 11 categories of difficult variations, among them 3 in camel position based on direction of the shoulder line: camel forward (CF) – with the shoulder line parallel to the ice; camel sideways (CS) – with the shoulder line twisted to a vertical position; camel upward (CU) – with the shoulder line twisted more than vertical position. If the free leg drops down for a long time while preparing for a difficult camel variation, the corresponding Level feature is still awarded, but the Judges will apply the GOE reduction for “poor/awkward/unaesthetic position(s)”.
“Change of foot executed by jump” & “Jump within a spin without change of foot”: are awarded only if the skater reaches a basic position within the first 2 revolutions after the landing.
“Both directions immediately following each other in sit or camel spin”: execution of spins in both directions (clockwise and counter clockwise) that immediately follow each other will be counted as a Level feature for sit and camel basic positions. A minimum of 3 revs in each direction is required. A Spin executed in both directions as above is considered as one Spin.
“Difficult variation of flying position in flying spins/spins with a flying entry”: is awarded only if the flying position is really difficult and the skater reaches a basic position within 2 revolutions after the landing. Normal flying camel entry does not block a possibility of counting a difficult flying entry as a feature.
Windmill (illusion) will be considered as a Level feature only the first time it’s attempted.

JUMPS
A jump will be considered as “Under-rotated” if it has missing rotation of 1⁄4 revolution or more, but less than 1⁄2 revolution.
Flip is taken-off from a backward inside edge, Lutz is taken-off from backward outside edge; Technical Panel decides on the take-off edge and indicates errors with signs “e” and “!”. In cases of serious errors (sign “e”) the base value of the jump and the GOE are reduced, in cases of smaller errors (sign “!”) the original base value stays and the GOE is reduced.
In Short Program jumps which do not satisfy the requirements (including wrong number of revs) will have no value, but will block a jumping box, if one is empty; if a combination of two double jumps is not allowed (Sr. Men & Ladies, Jr. Men), the jump with the lesser value after the consideration of signs <, <<, e will not count (e.g. 2Lz+2T*, 2T*+2Lo, 2Lz<+2T*, 2F<<*+2T).
In Short Program, the final GOE must be -5 if the Jump Element is not according to requirements. This means for example that the Jump Element has wrong number of revolutions, jump is repeated or jump combination has only one jump and the sign +COMBO.
Short Program, Repetitions: If the same jump is executed twice as a solo jump and as a part of the jump combination, the second execution will not be counted (if this repetition is in a jump combination, only the individual jump which is not according to the above requirements will not be counted).
Free Skating, extra jump elements: If an extra jump(s) is executed, only the individual jump(s), which is not according to the requirements will have no value. The jumps are considered in the order of execution.
Free Skating, Jump Sequences

A jump sequence consists of 2 (two) jumps of any number of revolutions, beginning with any listed jump, immediately followed by an Axel type jump with a direct step from the landing curve of the first jump to the take-off curve of the Axel jump.
Single Euler in between two listed jumps in jump combinations
Single Euler (1Eu) missing half a revolution or more will be considered as downgraded (<<). In this case the judges will apply the reduction for a downgraded jump.
If the Single Euler is missing less than half a revolution, it will not be considered as under-rotated (<) by the technical panel. If the Single Euler is not clearly jumped or it is executed as a step over, the judges will apply a reduction in GOE.

CLARIFICATIONS: LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY PAIR SKATING, season 2019/20

TWIST LIFTS
Feature 1) (Lady’s split): each leg straight or almost straight at least 45° from the body axis;
Feature 5) (Man’s arms): straight or almost straight, going sideways and reaching at least shoulder level.

LIFTS
Take-off: Simple: includes but is not limited to change of handhold on ascent of lift.
Difficult: includes but not limited to: Somersault take off, small lift going immediately into a Pair lift take-off without the Lady touching the ice between two lifts, one hand take-off, Spread Eagle, Ina Bauer or Spiral by one or both partners as the entry curve, inside Axel take-off in 5ALi and 5SLi.
Landing: Simple: different landing foot (not automatically considered), change of hold on descent.
Difficult: includes but is not limited to: Somersaults, variation in hold, partner positions and/or direction of landing, one hand landing, Spread-Eagle position of the Man during dismount.
Carry: Simple: duration at least 3 seconds. Difficult: includes at least one of the following features: during the carry the Man for at least 3 sec. skates on one foot or holds the partner on one arm or performs crossovers or performs Spread Eagle or a similar move. Allowed in both programs, but in SP does not count as a Feature and in FS counts only the first time executed.
Difficult variation of Lady’s position: a movement of leg, arm, or upper body which requires physical strength or flexibility and that has an effect on the balance of the main body core. Only these variations can increase the Level.
Change of hold/Lady’s position requires one full revolution of the Man before and after this change. If a change of hold and a change of Lady’s position are executed at the same time, only one Level feature will be awarded.
Variation of the take-off/landing, change of hold/Lady’s basic position and difficult variation of the Lady must be significantly different from the previously attempted variation/change to be awarded as a Level feature. One arm dismount can be counted as a feature only once per program.
Features “change of hold/Lady’s position/rotational direction” are not awarded if the change is interrupted by carry.
Feature 5) Difficult one hand hold of the man means:
- any lift in which there is only one point of contact between the man and the lady and the lady is balancing without supporting herself on the man;
- lifts with more than one point of contact which require exceptional balance and control (e.g. “star” lift where the lady is facing away from the man).

STEP SEQUENCES
Types of difficult turns and steps: rockers, counters, brackets, twizzles, loops and choctaws.
Same definition of minimum variety, simple variety and variety as for single skating; requirements must be fulfilled by both partners.
Use of body movements means the visible use for a combined total of at least 1/3 of the pattern of any movements of arms, head, torso, hips and legs that have an effect on the balance of the main body core.
Crossing at least 3 times of the partners for at least 1/3, but not more than 1/2 of the sequence. The partners must maintain not more than approximately three meters distance between each other throughout the crossing feature.
Not separating for at least half of the pattern: only one of the two features (but not both) can be awarded.

DEATH SPIRALS
Death spiral has a Level and value if both partners execute at least 1 rev in the death spiral position (knees of the Man clearly bent, his toe anchored and arm fully extended; Lady’s head must reach, at least briefly, the level of her skating knee). For a higher Level both Lady and Man must stay in the “low” position for 1 or more full revs.
Lady’s “low” position: for inside Death Spirals, the lowest hip or buttock and head should not be higher than her skating knee; for outside Death Spirals – head should not be higher than her skating knee and bodyline between knee of skating leg and head should be flat or shallow arch.
Man’s “low” pivot position: buttocks not higher than the knee of the pivot foot.
Any part of the Death Spiral with a higher Lady’s or Man’s position is not valid for Level features 2).
Change of arm hold by the Lady or Man is allowed, but is no longer a Level feature.
Change of pivot is considered as the end of the Death Spiral.
Entry, exit: The difficult entry position must be performed while both partners are on the entry curve and the Lady and/or the Man are moving from a difficult entry position directly and without delay to a Death Spiral position. The feature is awarded only if the low position is reached by both partners within 1 revolution after the man’s toe is fixed on the ice.
Exit: starts when the Man bends his “holding” arm at the elbow; ends: when the Lady comes to vertical position.

SOLO SPINS
Level feature “Difficult entrance into a spin” does not include regular backward entry and regular flying camel entry. Clarifications for Spins in Singles are also valid for Pair Skating (when applicable).

PAIR SPIN COMBINATION
Pair Spin Combination can be started with a jump. Any flying entry can be considered as a feature. If there are not 3 revolutions before or after the change of foot executed by both partners, the PCoSp will be marked with a “V”. If there is no attempt of a change of foot by either partner or there are less than 3 revolutions on both feet by either partner, the spin will have “No Value”.
Difficult exit – exiting in a lift or spinning movement, an innovative move that makes the exit significantly more difficult.

JUMPS, THROW JUMPS, TWIST LIFTS
In Short Program jumps, throw jumps and twist lifts which do not satisfy the requirements (including wrong number of revs) will have no value, but will block a corresponding element box, if one is empty.
In Free Skating, if an extra jump(s) is executed, only the individual jump(s), which is not according to the requirements, will have no value. The jumps are considered in the order of execution.


II. Updated Guidelines for marking +GOE of Single/Pair Skating Elements (positive aspects)
These guidelines are tools to be used together with the minus GOE charts. The final GOE of a performed element is based on the combination of both positive and negative aspects. It is important that the final GOE of an element reflects the positive aspects, as well as any possible reductions that may apply.
The final GOE of an element is calculated considering first the positive aspects of the element that result in a starting GOE for the evaluation. Following that a Judge reduces the GOE according to the guidelines of possible errors and the result is the final GOE of the element.
To establish the starting GOE Judges must take into consideration the bullets for each element. General recommendations are as follows:
FOR +1 : 1 bullet
FOR +2 : 2 bullets
FOR +3 : 3 bullets
FOR +4 : 4 bullets
FOR +5 : 5 or more bullets
FOR +4 and +5 THE FIRST THREE bullets highlighted in bold must be present Single Skating

IV. Updated Additional Remarks for Program Components and GOE

Program Components

If a program contains a Fall or a Serious error, the maximum scores are listed below:
Skating Skills, Transitions, Composition: Maximum score 9.75.
Performance and Interpretation: Maximum score 9.50.

If a program contains Falls or Serious errors, the maximum scores are listed below:
Skating Skills, Transitions, Composition: Maximum score 9.25.
Performance and Interpretation: Maximum score 8.75.

Serious errors are interruptions during the program and technical mistakes that impact the integrity/continuity/fluidity of the composition and/or its relation to the music.

Similer limitations must be applied to all levels of skaters from extremely poor to outstanding.
